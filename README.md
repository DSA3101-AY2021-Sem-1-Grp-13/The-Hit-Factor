## About The Project

Every year, millions of songs are being released, but not all songs become popular. Like any
craft, music production requires a lot of time and effort, as a song has to go through several
iterations of recording and fine-tuning before it can be released. In addition, artists also invest a
lot of money into their music, be it for promotional materials, scheduling world tours, or as
merchandise for their fans. While some songs make it to the top hits, others remain unheard of.

On Spotify, the payout range averages to $0.004 per stream, and for an artist to earn $4,000, they
would require approximately a million listens on Spotify, which is only achievable by the
biggest hits. Do popular songs share similar musical traits, or are there external factors not even
related to the composition of a piece that makes it popular? By knowing the traits of popular
music, production companies can make more informed decisions on their budgeting and many
more factors that go into the music production.

In this project, we adopted several statistical learning methods to gain information about the
different song features in hopes to find out which feature(s) contribute(s) largely to a song’s
popularity.
